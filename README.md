# Talking Pigeon

One of my favorite projects and the beginning of my journey as a mobile developer using flutter. 

A little brief about the project, talking pigeon is a full fledged chat app for mobile built using flutter where users can come, make an account and start conversing with their friends by using their friend's username. This app has a very simple and an intuitive design which always is my main concern which building any mobile app and this follows the same protocol. I have designed the icon, animations and the whole UI all by myself. I would want you to go ahead and try my app since I had put in so much efforts into it. Reason being, there was no guidance/tutorials or even blogs that I could visit in order to follow it. I had to combine the knowledge and guidance from many sources and had to come up with my own approach in order to solve the most puzzling part of the app, arranging messages in decreasing order timestamp. 
This project was very much appreciated by my concerned faculties in college and I would furthur like to make increments over time to make it as good as it can be.

Following are the screenshots for the app itself, have a look:

 Th isapplication will have its own unique style of communication between individuals by applying new, novel method of storage and processing of the message threads which will make concurrency and synchronization dependent processing efficient. Talking pigeon aims to be a meritorious application by keeping in mind the UI and UX challenges that every app faces and no compensation has been instilled in this aspect of application building.

##Conclusion

Security element was built within user registration, user login, and message exchange and database storage. Possible future works that need to be highlighted includes an update of security tools to the latest version, a variable file size for the purpose of file transfer and incorporating functionalities like voice communication or live chatting. Although the application was built to find friends by knowing their usernames explicitly, we hope to include an overall search option for users to find people with enhanced profiles and make friends. We also hope to implement the peer-to-peer network architecture to make the application decentralized and introduce groups in the application. In making the application more secure, we should also offer different authentication and encryption algorithms to be chosen by users. Whenever possible, key size should be allowed to be negotiated manually by the users. With large migration from PC based to mobile based application, we could also use phone number for device identity as that found in Whatapp application.
