# Talking Pigeon

One of my favorite projects and the beginning of my journey as a mobile developer using flutter. 

A little brief about the project, talking pigeon is a full fledged chat app for mobile built using flutter where users can come, make an account and start conversing with their friends by using their friend's username. This app has a very simple and an intuitive design which always is my main concern which building any mobile app and this follows the same protocol. I have designed the icon, animations and the whole UI all by myself. I would want you to go ahead and try my app since I had put in so much efforts into it. Reason being, there was no guidance/tutorials or even blogs that I could visit in order to follow it. I had to combine the knowledge and guidance from many sources and had to come up with my own approach in order to solve the most puzzling part of the app, arranging messages in decreasing order timestamp. 
This project was very much appreciated by my concerned faculties in college and I would furthur like to make increments over time to make it as good as it can be.

Following are the screenshots for the app itself, have a look:
